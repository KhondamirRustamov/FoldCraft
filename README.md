<h1>FoldCraft</h1>

<h3>Fold-conditioned de novo binder design</h3>
FoldCraft enables fold-conditioning of binder structure, enabling design of binders with diverse folds like TIM-barrels, solenoid folds or Ig-like domains. 
Using VHH conditioned framework FoldCraft can succesfully design single domain nanobody binders against diverse tergets. The FoldCraft pipeline is described in this preprint

You can easily run FoldCraft on Google Colab using this ![link]([url](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4DksUdJP0n1aLWF_RnupDSgrdJEhXlX?authuser=1))
